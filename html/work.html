        <h3>The Newb and The Knower Podcast is a Chicago-based fly fishing podcast that brings expert advice and insights to its audience. Each episode features seasoned fly fishing professionals sharing valuable tips and techniques, along with explorations of diverse fishing locations and new spots.

        I was commissioned to develop marketing materials for the podcast, specifically for their new "Adventures" series. To capture the essence of adventure and exploration, I designed travel postcards that evoke a vintage, warm aesthetic. I carefully edited the provided photos and selected complementary font pairings to achieve this desired effect.</h3>
